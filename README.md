Lyxkonfektyr_Test_Website

## Description

My project is about being able to find our company's "Lyxkonfektyr AB" products in different categories.
I have created three different html pages that you can navigate with navbar at the beginning of each page.
in the first page index.html I worked on presenting whole products that you can find in the carousel. in the next and third html pages I presented chrism's and ester as well as all kinds of chocolates separately. In order to see the prices of the products, I have created a price section that is linked to different pages from the first. if you click on the pictures you will get a pdf page with price list.
The project has only the purpose of learning from Code institute and to be a real and large website, you have to add more functions.
I have used the functions below to create my project:
HTML,
CSS,
GITHUB,
GIT,
Bootstrap,
Bootstrap snippets,
FontAwsome,
Google Font,
W3schools,
Internet,
Balsamiq,

And finally Code Institute online course materials,
 


All Images in my project coming from our originally website.

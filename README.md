# Project_Name

Lyxkonfektyr_Test_Website

## Description

My project is about being able to find our company "Lyxkonfektyr AB's" products in different categories. 
You can get in touch with our respective departments and order Chocolate and Marzipan via email. To call or follow our newsletter and social medias there is a phone number and links.


## UX
This site is intended for consumers of different kinds who want to buy chocolate and marzipan, it can be private individuals, small shops or large shopping centers.
This site can help them quickly see which products there are and which one they need.
The project has the opportunity to develop even more for people who can shop directly from the web and this is another good functionality that can be achieved as an informative and actionable meeting place.
You can find an example from Balsamiq that helps for wireframes in the project catalog.

## Feature
I have created three different html pages where you can use navbar to navigate at the beginning of each page.
You can download a video of our Christmas products in the first page "index.html". 
I worked on presenting whole products that you can find in the first carousel from the first page. 
In the next and third html pages I presented Christmas and Easter as well as all kinds of chocolates separately.
In order to see the prices of the products, I have created a price section in "index.html" that is linked to different pages from the first. 
If you click on the download button in each pages you will get a pdf page with a price list.


## Features Left to Implement
My project beyond the commonly mentioned purpose has had a learning purpose from the code institute milestone project and there is a lot of development opportunity's for the future.
An example of such a development idea might be to have an extra page or extra feature to shop directly from the web

## Testing
Mickrosoft Edge: I could not even open my link.
Mozilla FireFox: it was very fast and showed everything much better and nicer, and I could open every link and page in my mobile too.
Chrome: I worked all the time with Chrome developementtools and all pages and link in with all the different sizes looked perfectly and were responsive.
Safari: i used a iphone and everything worked as it should have there was nothing wrong and i had no issues. It was also very responsive.


## Deployment

I run my codes from the beginning in GitPod which has a workspace for the GitHub page and I also configure and run my updates to commit them and i also
pushed my codes in each finished section of the Github page. sometimes I tested some codes in coderply.com but later typed them into gitpod.
To deploy my pages, I will change my branch to master it in GitHub.
